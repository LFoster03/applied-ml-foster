# Project 3 – Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, we use the Titanic dataset to build and evaluate three classifiers: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. We compare model performance across three different feature sets and reflect on their effectiveness for predicting passenger survival.

# Steps

- Create the virtual environment

- Use Python’s built-in venv module: python -m venv .venv. .venv is the folder where your virtual environment will be stored.After this, your project folder will have a .venv directory.Tip: Use lowercase .venv (or venv) for convention. VS Code automatically recognizes .venv.

- Activate the virtual environment: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1. A requirements.txt lists all the Python packages your project needs so others (or you in a new environment) can install them easily with pip install -r requirements.txt.

### For Project 3 – Titanic Dataset Analysis, here’s a typical requirements.txt you can use:

pandas==2.2.0
numpy==1.26.0
matplotlib==3.8.1
seaborn==0.12.2
scikit-learn==1.3.2
jupyter==1.0.0
notebook==7.8.0

- How to use it - Save this file as requirements.txt in your project folder. Make sure your virtual environment is activated (.venv). Install all packages with: pip install -r requirements.txt. Select .venv as the kernel. Tell VS Code to use this .venv interpreter. Press Ctrl+Shift+P → type Python: Select Interpreter. Look for the interpreter in your .venv, e.g.:C:\Repos\project02\.venv\Scripts\python.exe. Select it. Reload VS Code to make sure it takes effect. This makes your editor aware of all packages installed in .venv.
