# Project 4 – Predicting a Continuous Target with Regression: Titanic Dataset
**Name:** Lindsay Foster 
**Date:** 11/11/2025

## Introduction
This project builds on the Titanic dataset used in Project 3. This project will predict fare and the amount of money paid for the journey. This will predict a continuous numeric target.

# Steps

- Create the virtual environment

- Use Python’s built-in venv module: python -m venv .venv. .venv is the folder where your virtual environment will be stored.After this, your project folder will have a .venv directory.Tip: Use lowercase .venv (or venv) for convention. VS Code automatically recognizes .venv.

- Activate the virtual environment: .venv\Scripts\Activate. A requirements.txt lists all the Python packages your project needs so others (or you in a new environment) can install them easily with pip install -r requirements.txt.

- How to use it - Save this file as requirements.txt in your project folder. Make sure your virtual environment is activated (.venv). Install all packages with: pip install -r requirements.txt. Select .venv as the kernel. Tell VS Code to use this .venv interpreter. Press Ctrl+Shift+P → type Python: Select Interpreter. Look for the interpreter in your .venv, e.g.:C:\Repos\project02\.venv\Scripts\python.exe. Select it. Reload VS Code to make sure it takes effect. This makes your editor aware of all packages installed in .venv.
