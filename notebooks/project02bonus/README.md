Project: Iris Dataset Analysis
1. Introduction

Dataset description: The Iris dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers with four features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width and a target species (three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

Goal: Predict the species of iris flowers based on the four numerical features.

2. Data Exploration

Check the structure of the dataset:

Number of rows and columns.

Feature types (numeric vs categorical).

Check for missing values:

Count how many missing values exist per column.

Iris dataset usually has no missing values, so you likely donâ€™t need imputation.

Check unique values:

Target variable (species) has three classes.

Statistical summary:

Mean, median, min, max, standard deviation for each numeric feature.

Visual exploration:

Pair plots, scatterplots, or boxplots for feature distributions by species.

3. Feature Selection

Input features (X): sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width.

Target (y): species.

Reflection:

These features are numeric and likely predictive of species.

Petal length and width often show strong separation between classes.

4. Train/Test Split

Split the data into training and test sets, e.g., 80% train, 20% test.

Check class distribution of the target in train and test sets.

Consider stratification to preserve class proportions across the split.

Reflection:

Ensures each species is adequately represented in both sets.

Improves model reliability.

5. Model Training

Choose a classifier, e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, or Decision Tree.

Train the model using the training set features (X_train) and target (y_train).

Reflection:

Assess which features contribute most to prediction.

Iris dataset is well-suited to classification because of clear separability of species.

6. Model Evaluation

Predict species on test set.

Calculate metrics such as:

Accuracy

Confusion matrix

Precision, recall, F1-score for each class

Reflection:

Check if the model misclassifies specific species.

Evaluate whether class balance or feature scaling affects results.

7. Feature Importance / Visualization

Optional:

Visualize decision boundaries for 2D feature combinations.

Plot feature importance if using tree-based classifiers.

Reflection:

Understand which features are most useful for separating classes.

8. Summary / Conclusion

Summarize key findings:

Which features are most predictive.

How well the model performs on unseen data.

Any insights about species separability or misclassifications.
